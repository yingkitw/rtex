   git clone https://github.com/yingkitw/pdfrs.git
   cd pdfrs
   ```
3. Create a new branch for your feature:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-name
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Building

```bash
cargo build
```

### Running Tests

```

## Contributing Guidelines

### Types of Contributions

We welcome the following types of contributions:

1. **Bug Reports**: File issues for bugs you encounter
2. **Feature Requests**: Suggest new features
3. **Pull Requests**: Submit code improvements
4. **Documentation**: Improve documentation
5. **Tests**: Add or improve tests

### Submitting Changes

1. Ensure your code follows the project's style
2. Add tests for new functionality
3. Update documentation as needed
4. Ensure all tests pass
5. Commit your changes with descriptive messages
6. Push to your fork
7. Create a pull request

### Commit Message Format

Use conventional commit messages:

- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation changes
- `style:` for code style changes
- `refactor:` for code refactoring
- `test:` for adding tests
- `chore:` for maintenance tasks

Example:

```
feat: add PDF encryption support

- Implement password protection for PDFs
- Add user/owner permission controls
- Update CLI interface with encryption options
- Add tests for encryption functionality
```

### Code Review Process

1. All submissions require review
2. Maintainers may request changes
3. Address feedback promptly
4. Maintain a respectful, constructive tone

## Architecture

The project is organized into several modules:

- `pdf/`: PDF parsing and text extraction
- `pdf_generator/`: PDF creation from scratch
- `markdown/`: Markdown parsing and conversion
- `image/`: Image handling for PDFs
- `compression/`: Stream compression utilities

When adding features, consider which module they belong to or if a new module is needed.

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run specific test
cargo test test_name

# Run with output
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

### Adding Tests

1. Add unit tests to `src/lib.rs`
2. Test both success and failure cases
3. Use descriptive test names
4. Keep tests focused and isolated

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

Add Rust doc comments to public functions:

```rust
/// Converts a PDF file to Markdown format
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `input_file` - Path to the input PDF file
/// * `output_file` - Path to the output Markdown file
///
/// # Returns
///
/// `Ok(())` if successful, `Err(e)` otherwise
pub fn pdf_to_markdown(input_file: &str, output_file: &str) -> Result<()> {
    // implementation
}
```

### User Documentation

Update relevant documentation files at the **project root**:

- `README.md` for user-facing features
- `SPEC.md` for technical specifications
- `TODO.md` for backlog / roadmap
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` for architectural decisions

Supplementary docs live under `docs/`.

## Performance Considerations

- Profile code changes with `cargo bench`
- Consider memory usage for large files
- Optimize for common use cases
- Document performance characteristics

## Security

- Follow secure coding practices
- Validate input data
- Handle errors gracefully
- Don't expose sensitive data in logs

## Release Process

Releases are versioned using semantic versioning:

1. **Major**: Breaking changes
2. **Minor**: New features (backward compatible)
3. **Patch**: Bug fixes (backward compatible)

## Getting Help
