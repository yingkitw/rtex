# Agent Development Loop

This document defines the continuous improvement cycle for the **pdfrs** PDF/Markdown toolkit.

## The Loop

### 1. Complete Remaining TODO Items
Pick the next highest-priority item from `TODO.md` (or `ARCHITECTURE.md` if the task is architectural). Implement it with minimal, focused changes. Do not add speculative features.

### 2. Create Tests and Examples
For every new capability:
- Write integration tests (e.g. `tests/integration.rs`, `tests/comprehensive_pdf.rs`) that exercise the feature end-to-end
- Add unit tests for core logic where appropriate
- Provide a minimal usage example if the feature is client-facing

### 3. Ensure `cargo test` Passes
Run the full test suite. Fix any failures before proceeding. Warnings are acceptable but should be noted.

### 4. Loop Back to Step 1
Return to `TODO.md` and pick the next item. Repeat until the backlog is clear.

### 5. Audit and Optimize
After each batch of features, perform a quality pass:
- **Maintainability**: Are functions small and well-named? Is the module structure logical?
- **Leanness**: Remove dead code, unused imports, and speculative abstractions
- **Wiring**: Ensure all new features are properly integrated into `main.rs`, CLI args, and docs
- **Small footprint**: Avoid unnecessary dependencies; prefer standard library or lightweight crates
- **Consistency**: Match existing code style and patterns

### 6. Competitive Intelligence
Research similar open-source PDF toolkits and Markdown→PDF pipelines (typst, pandoc, weasyprint, pdfium wrappers, Gigapdf, etc.). Identify capabilities they have that this project lacks. Add the most valuable ones to the `TODO.md` brainstorming section. Prioritize features that provide clear competitive advantage.

### 7. Update Documentation
Keep all project docs aligned with the current implementation. Root docs (required):

- **`README.md`**: Quick start, CLI options (`pdfcli` binary), feature list, architecture summary
- **`TODO.md`**: Mark completed items, move them to Done, keep brainstorming current
- **`SPEC.md`**: Functional requirements, Element model, CLI semantics, error handling
- **`ARCHITECTURE.md`**: Module relationships, data flow, deployment topology

Supplementary material lives under `docs/`. Update **`AGENTS.md`** if the loop itself evolves.

## Principles

- **Simplicity over flexibility**: Solve the problem at hand, not every hypothetical future problem
- **Surgical changes**: Touch only what you must; clean up only your own mess
- **Goal-driven**: Every change should have a verifiable success criterion
- **Test before ship**: No feature is complete until it has passing tests
- **Docs are code**: Documentation drift is a bug
